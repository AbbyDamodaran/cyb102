Hello! This is a part of my application for CodePath's Cybersecurity course, and will later serve as a space to store work for class.

Here are some CodePath resources that you might find handy:
- CodePath's page on the cybersecurity course offered: https://www.codepath.org/courses/cybersecurity
- Pre-work details for the course application: https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/cyb102/prework
- Detailed syllabus of CodePath's course from a previous year: https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/cybersecurity_university/syllabus_quarter

For independent exploration, this seems to be a good place to start: https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path
